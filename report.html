**MITracker - Final Report**

Have you ever wanted to walk to class while completely avoiding every other living person? Have you ever wanted to find a quiet spot on campus to study, medidate, or perhaps ponder over better times? If so then MITracker is perfect for you! We provide a webapp which shows the average population density of MIT
on a per-hour basis - and visualizes this density on a map which can be used to understand which parts of MIT are popping at different times of day.

Front-End
===============================================================================
The systems starts in freeplay mode and displays a nice options menu interface to allow the user to change the mode if they want.
We have implemented the following modes: Freeplay Mode, Recording Mode, Song Mode, and Sequencer Mode.

ESPs (or whatever)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our system’s default state will be this “idle” state where nothing happens if you walk up the stairs/through the pathway. 
We added this just in case people want to turn off the system at night without unplugging the ESP32.

Web App (or whatever sections you need)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The “free play” mode of the system will detect the user’s steps and as a result, a corresponding frequency will be played on the buzzer. 
We define a "step" as every time the laser beam is broken when a foot is placed between the laser and the phototransistor.  We integrated an LED strip to light up with every step that is taken on the stairs.  In this mode, only the most recently broken laser beam's frequency and light will play.

Database
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the database we use python SQLite to create .db file from the request handler upon the first POST request. The data is originally inserted into a set of
production databases called 'prod{x}' where {x} is the version of the table (1, 2, 3 ...).

Once the data is put into the database, it is then processed off the server manually (because the server does not allow us / give us permission to have a python process to do it automatically),
and put into another table called 'processed'.
