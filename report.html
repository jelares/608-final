**MITracker - Final Report**

Have you ever wanted to walk to class while completely avoiding every other living person? Have you ever wanted to find a quiet spot on campus to study, medidate, or perhaps ponder over better times? If so then MITracker is perfect for you! We provide a webapp which shows the average population density of MIT
on a per-hour basis - and visualizes this density on a map which can be used to understand which parts of MIT are popping at different times of day.

Front-End
===============================================================================
The systems starts in freeplay mode and displays a nice options menu interface to allow the user to change the mode if they want.
We have implemented the following modes: Freeplay Mode, Recording Mode, Song Mode, and Sequencer Mode.

ESPs (or whatever)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our system’s default state will be this “idle” state where nothing happens if you walk up the stairs/through the pathway. 
We added this just in case people want to turn off the system at night without unplugging the ESP32.

Web App (or whatever sections you need)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The “free play” mode of the system will detect the user’s steps and as a result, a corresponding frequency will be played on the buzzer. 
We define a "step" as every time the laser beam is broken when a foot is placed between the laser and the phototransistor.  We integrated an LED strip to light up with every step that is taken on the stairs.  In this mode, only the most recently broken laser beam's frequency and light will play.

Database
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the database we use python SQLite to create .db file from the request handler upon the first POST request. The data is originally inserted into a set of
production databases called 'prod{x}' where {x} is the version of the table (1, 2, 3 ...).

Once the data is put into the database, it is then processed off the server manually (because the server does not allow us / give us permission to have a python process to do it automatically),
and put into another table called 'processed'.

Data Collected from ESP32 on Post Requests
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The data is collected in the Post request handler, in the request_handler.py function. The data must be posted as form encoded, and contain the following key value pairs:

{'lat': float latitude of data collection point, 'lon': float longitude of data collection point, 'MAC': JSON array of string MAC addresses}.

The server then takes these requests and inserts a single data point, per MAC address in the array, into a production table as mentioned below, along with a timestamp.

Data Processing
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Upon the production tables reaching a certain size, we manually download them onto our machines and run a data processing script on them. Note we do this manually instead of automatically because we do not have permission to
run processes on the server.

The processing script goes through all production tables, count each data point (unique MAC address) for every distinct (lat, lon, hour) triplet and generates a count value for the triplet. The way the 'hour' quantity is determined is 
by taking the hour portion of a point's timestamp. Upon the generation of the 96 unique {(lat, lon, hour): count} pairs (24 hours * 4 data collection locations), we update the 96 corresponding points in the 'processed' database table by adding the
new counts onto the old counts which are already in the processed table (these counts are initialized to zero). What we end up with is a database table named 'processed' with 96 rows of the following form: 

{lat, lon, hour, count}

When the data processing is complete, the database file with the update 'processed' table is re-uploaded to the server manually.

Get Requests
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With the processed data on the server, the GET request simply has to take build the visualization. The visualization consists of a hotspot representation of the population density on campus, placed on a map, for a given hour. The creation of the visualizations, hotspots, and size of the hotspots
is talked about in the data visualization section. The GET request therefore must take in an hour query parameter in the URL. It then uses this hour parameter to go through the location points and get the counts for those locations parameterized by a given hour. It then turns these data points into
hotspots for those locations at that hour, and returns the visualization as an html file.

It creates an HTML map file, called cambridge.hmtl, which is them embedded with our visualizations, visualizations.png, and returned from the handler.
